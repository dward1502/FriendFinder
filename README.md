# Friend Finder
This application created a pseudo friend finder similar to match.com. This was accomplished by utilizing npm packages and running a server onto heroku.
Some things that I had difficulty with was getting the post data to properly send to my apiRoutes.js file and be able to retrieve the values for the array.

## Heroku
The website is hosted on this heroku site [Link to deployed heroku site!](https://shrouded-eyrie-27445.herokuapp.com/)

### Technology used

1. NPM (node package manager)
2. express
3. body-parser
4. Heroku
